# CURRENT STATE

- Repository: `KaspaPulse/kaspa-gateway-rust`.
- Active task: `KASPA_GATEWAY_100_PERCENT_RUST_MIGRATION_20260923`.
- Current branch: `feat/owned-implementation-100-percent-rust-20260923`.
- Current HEAD: **VERIFY DYNAMICALLY** before every commit/publication decision; last verified runtime-automation checkpoint is `02c75b87060da96efe8b843deefccdf8363ff459`, tree `21d61d96672c2d0eaf7a9c5d6a86f41a2f79eb38`.
- Current remote main: **VERIFY DYNAMICALLY** immediately before GitHub publication/integration; task baseline was `aaf2c635672c0fd35a5705579610be8de188b031`.
- Working tree: **NOT VERIFIED** after this state-document update; verify dynamically before effective-node-settings source mutation. Commit `02c75b8...` was verified clean.
- Current Rust source inventory: 85.
- Current owned non-Rust programming source debt: 108.
- Current non-Rust execution-wiring debt: 14.
- Rust language guard: PASS; unapproved source=0; unapproved execution=0.
- Technical exceptions: 1 — required ClusterFuzzLite `build.sh` thin adapter delegating project logic to Rust.
- KSSS owned adapter: Rust/PyO3; five superseded KGW-owned Python adapter/gate files removed after parity.
- Signed KSSS central runtime: unchanged third-party archive; SHA-256 `38309d2ab8fa30096d99940f855e88173faa182e60db33f2a96b2d3408507430`.
- KSSS Rust regressions: 24/24 PASS; full xtask tests: 47/47 PASS on stable and 47/47 PASS on MSRV 1.97.1.
- Stable check/Clippy `-D warnings`/FMT PASS; MSRV feature check/test PASS.
- Old/new KSSS semantic parity: PASS for check/evaluate/knowledge/release-check/trust, including cryptographic verification with pinned Cosign v3.0.6.
- Continuity validation after this state update: **NOT VERIFIED** until rerun.
- Local actionlint/cargo-audit/cargo-deny/cargo-machete: **NOT VERIFIED / unavailable locally**; exact-head GitHub CI is required.
- Production/DNS/Cloudflare/live runtime mutation: NO.
- Protected historical checkpoint mutation: NO.
- Remote GitHub mutation for this task: NO.

## NEXT ACTION
Port `tools/kgw_effective_node_settings_gate.cjs` to Rust with parity-first regression coverage over unchanged product source. Do not replay KSSS/network-generation/runtime-automation qualification without predicate invalidation.

## DO NOT REPEAT
Do not replay Desktop runtime/native/E2E/release qualification without predicate invalidation. Do not rerun verified KSSS parity/47-test qualification merely because the phase advances. Do not restore deleted Python adapters, touch unrelated worktrees/protected checkpoint, weaken signed-runtime boundaries, or hide debt with Linguist/automatic baselining.
